Notes
===============

1. symbolic systems give generated stories goals and coherence in a way that neural systems (to date) cannot match since
   neural networks rely on temporal, Bayesian relations between sentences, instead of (narrative) causal relations.
2. principle of minimal departure
    1. one is to assume that a fictional world matches my actual world as closely as possible
3. Modelling pre- and post-conditions for ensuring causal coherence has been used in a variety of domains.
4. The Genre Expectation Model
    1. Given a corpus of stories from a genre related to the fictional world that the agent will inhabit, I train a
       genre expectation model. This model provides the probability, according to the genre-specific corpus, that
       certain events will happen after other events.
