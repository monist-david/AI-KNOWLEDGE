Notes
===============

1. Previously, most story generation systems have used symbolic planning [21] or case-based reasoning [29]. While these
   automated story generation systems were able to produce impressive results, they rely on a human-knowledge engineer
   to provide symbolic domain models that indicated legal characters, actions, and knowledge about when character
   actions can and cannot be performed.
2. The most common form of interactive narrative involves the user taking on the role of the protagonist in an unfolding
   storyline. The user can also be a disembodied observer—as if watching a movie—but capable of making changes to the
   world or talking to the characters
3. Open story generation [46] is the problem of automatically generating a story about any domain without a priori
   manual knowledge engineering. Open story generation requires an intelligent system to either learn a domain model
   from available data [46], [47] or to reuse data and knowledge available from a corpus, whether already decomposed
   into symbolic facts [48] or not [49].
