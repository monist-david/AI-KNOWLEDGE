Question
===============

1. definition of concurrency uses and how to access this number from general user base metrics (for example, a chatbot
   website)
2. how to enhance unique personality of the chatbot, through fine-tune? Any other alternatives? for example, would RAG
   work too?
3. what about multilingual? Is it through pure translation or native foreigh language corpus traning? (Chinese for
   example)
4. Let's say our max concurrency estimated around 1K users (but hovering around hundreds range mostly) to use for
   E-commerce site focusing on dog care, what is the recommendation for a COST-EFFECTIVE infra setup?
5. Pay-as-you-go VS. a flat fee, which is more cost-efficient for a 3-month campaign used in the scenario described
   above? (in such case, user acquistition takes time so to reach a concurrent hundres it takes a few months)
6. How to best fine-tune for a particular story setting - for example, a dog playing fetch with owner in a park.
7. the price difference on GPU and CPU
8. if you fine-tune the OPT 1.3b, what kind of performance can you guarantee me? Is it the same usage as the GPT-neo-x
   fine-tuned chatbot version (prompt)
9. Can I change the concurrency number anytime or once a month?
